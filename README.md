# Boris Bikes :bicyclist:

A project to emulate the TfL cycle hire network. The program will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make the TfL cycle hire a reality.

## Dependancies

To run tests you will need RSpec gem installed:

```
$ gem install rspec
```
