# Boris Bikes :bicyclist:

A project to emulate the TfL cycle hire network. The program will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make the TfL cycle hire a reality.

## Dependancies

Installation.

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone

# change into root folder
cd boris-bikes

# install dependancies
bundle install
```

To run tests, chance into root folder, then run rspec.

```bash
rspec
```

## Process

This challenge was tackled using the TDD method. All code was written test first. This means before writing any production code I had to create a test to justify it. Once I had a failing test that tested for a behaviour I could then write code to make that test pass. 
   
Completed using the **RED** - **GREEN** - **REFACTOR** cycle.

Initial domain modelling done and shown [here](domain-model.md).
