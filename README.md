# Boris Bikes :bicyclist:

A project to emulate the TfL cycle hire network. The program will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make the TfL cycle hire a reality.

## Dependancies

To run tests you will need RSpec gem installed:

```
$ gem install rspec
```

## Process

This challenge was tackled using the TDD method. All code was written test first. This means before writing any production code I had to create a test to justify it. Once I had a failing test that tested for a behaviour I could then write code to make that test pass.    
Completed using the **RED** - **GREEN** - **REFACTOR** cycle.
